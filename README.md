# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
This project includes a full comparision between sentiment analysis conducted by 2 models: VADER and RoBERTa
Dataset used in this project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
In this dataset, there are 500k reviews but I've only used first 500 for simplicity.
The second file includes the whole project with training of both models...but in RoBERTa model, due to need of high computational requirement I couldn't train it on my dataset but its code is present in it.
